# NeuralProphetStockPrediction

For a more detailed explanation of why stock prediction is such a challenging task, check out the full article:  
[Why Stock Prediction is Difficult: AI Edition](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/why-stock-prediction-is-difficult-ai-edition-820548f3ea9d).

Key points from the article include:
- **Market Complexity**: The stock market is influenced by an almost infinite number of variables, many of which are not captured by historical data alone.
- **Black Swan Events**: Unexpected, rare events (e.g., financial crises, pandemics) can dramatically alter stock prices, making it impossible to predict these outliers with any regularity.
- **Data Quality and Availability**: Inaccurate, missing, or incomplete data can lead to flawed predictions.
- **Human Behavior**: Stock prices often react to psychological factors such as panic or greed, which are difficult to model with AI.

### **Conclusion**

While deep learning models like NeuralProphet offer a promising framework for time series forecasting, they are not a "silver bullet" for stock prediction. Stock markets are inherently unpredictable due to their sensitivity to a wide array of factors that are not well captured in historical price data alone.

For those interested in building AI-based models for stock forecasting, it is important to understand the limitations of such models and approach stock prediction with caution. Incorporating additional data sources and improving model robustness against market volatility are key steps forward. However, even with advanced techniques, it remains unclear whether accurate and consistent stock prediction is achievable at scale.

### **Getting Started**

If you're still interested in experimenting with NeuralProphet for stock price forecasting, hereâ€™s how to get started:



1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ambeckley/NeuralProphetStockPrediction.git
   ```

2. Create a csv based on a stock ticker to use with NeuralProphet. I used TSLA.

3. Run The MultiStep.ipynb file
